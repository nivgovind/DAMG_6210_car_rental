- Payments can be made through previously saved payment methods (CC and debit card).
- Saved payment methods will be checked if they are within expiry date.
- Billing address will be assumed to be the address provided in user information unless changed.
- Customers should have a valid DL and should be over 21 years to be able to rent a car.
- Customer should have at least one payment method saved before making a reservation
- Reservation becomes confirmed only if the transaction is approved/successful and the vehicle's availability is verified.
- Customers can update their reservation, subject to vehicle availability and transaction status.
- Customers will have the option of choosing from insurance types in the system before making the reservation. If not, a default insurance type will be assigned.
